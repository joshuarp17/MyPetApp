The Tamagotchi App was designed to be able to interact with your pet. The app allows you to interact with your pet by feeding, cleaning, and playing with them. Three
numerical values linked with the 3 actions performed indicate the result of your interactions with your pet. 

There are 3 buttons added to change the image view according to the action performed by the user eg. If the Feed button is clicked an ImageView with the pet eating will be displayed. When each button is clicked it displays a numerical value in the 3 TextViews. The button clicked increases the value by 10 while the other two values decrease by 5.

The appâ€™s background was created with the use of Canva to display a colourful, well-designed theme that fits well with the environment of taking care of a pet.
The app consists of two Screens. The front page is a welcome screen designed to introduce the user who has entered the app, and the second screen is the main display of the Tamagotchi App.

GitHub actions were used to create a repository with the same name as my Android app to transfer the code directly through GiitHub by committing a push. I used GitHub actions to automate my build in which a workflow is created that tests the repository. Enabling Version Control allowed me to commit directory. After adding the URL of my GitHub repository link, the code for the Tamagotchi app was immediately transferred to the GitHub repository.
